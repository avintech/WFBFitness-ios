  <h2>Thoughts and Reflections</h2>
  <p>Developing WFBFitness has been an enriching and educational journey, offering a deep dive into iOS app development with SwiftUI. This project allowed for experimentation with various aspects of app development, from backend integration to user authentication and interface design.</p>
  <p>Creating a REST API in PHP for server communication and database interaction was a key part of this learning experience. It provided insights into effective backend development and the importance of seamless app-server data exchange.</p>
  <p>Implementing diverse authentication methods like Apple Sign In and Google Sign In was also an integral part of the development process, highlighting the need for secure and user-friendly login experiences.</p>
  <p>Utilizing Firebase for authentication and database operations enhanced my understanding of cloud-based solutions and their role in dynamic content management within apps.</p>
  <p>This project, though not fully complete, has been a significant learning experience, enhancing my skills in various areas of iOS app development and providing a comprehensive view of building functional and user-centric applications.</p>
